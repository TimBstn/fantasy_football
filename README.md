# Fantasy Football - Use Machine Learning to predict future performance 

Fantasy football has become a widely popular and engaging pastime, with millions of participants worldwide. Accurate prediction of player performance and points is crucial for fantasy football enthusiasts to make informed decisions when selecting their fantasy teams. This project addresses the problem of predicting fantasy football points using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on regression and neural networks.

In this project, we employ a comprehensive dataset of historical player statistics, encompassing variables such as player attributes, team dynamics, and previous performance. We explore the performance of two primary machine learning methodologies: multiple linear regression and artificial neural networks. Our analysis involves feature engineering and selection to enhance the predictive power of the models.

We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques by considering metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared. Additionally, we investigate the potential of model interpretability, enabling fantasy football enthusiasts to gain insights into the factors influencing player performance predictions.

The results of our experiments demonstrate the comparative strengths and weaknesses of regression and neural networks in predicting fantasy football points. We also discuss the implications of our findings for fantasy football enthusiasts and researchers in the field of sports analytics. This prject serves as a valuable reference for those seeking to leverage machine learning techniques to gain a competitive edge in the world of fantasy football.

# Notes
- prediction is PPR style - explain
- https://github.com/DelanoDZR/fpl-predictor-neural-nets/blob/main/models.py - models

# Prediction
- use average of last n games
- for regression: normalize data before predicting
- opponent record as percentage
- home/away game?
- opponents rank defensive, offensive (split by receiving, rushing, total)

# Next Steps
- vs divisional opponent, AFC, NFC
- Projected Points of ESPN
- Time Series LSTM-RNN model
- use NLP such as in (Baugham 2021): The paper details a novel machine learning NLP pipeline incorporating statistical entity detectors and deep learning feedforward neural networks with 98 layers for player classification. It achieves a high analogy test accuracy of 100% and keyword test accuracy of 80% using news articles, videos, and expert opinions, while providing player classifications and point projections with low Root Mean Squared Error.
- create starting lineup (Gupta 2019); "
Using the points for the past years, time series forecasting techniques were leveraged to predict next yearâ€™s performance. To
be robust in approach and consider both linearity and non-linearity, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were considered for modelling. After obtaining the points for the entire roster, Linear
Programming (LPP) basics were applied to adhere to all constraints and finalise a suitable starting dream team."
